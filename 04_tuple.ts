/**
 * 
* ðŸš€ Key Takeaways:
* âœ” Tuples are fixed-length arrays with specific types.
* âœ” Elements must be in the correct order & type.
* âœ” push() works but can break strict typing.
* âœ” Use readonly to prevent modification.
* âœ” Named tuples improve readability.
* 
* let tupleName: [type1, type2, type3] = [value1, value2, value3];
